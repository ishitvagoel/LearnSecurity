# E1 — AI, LLM, and agentic application security (7 Transfer)

**Kind:** transfer-challenge  
**Loop step:** 7 Transfer  
**Standards:** OWASP GenAI LLM Top 10 2026 (awareness, not syllabus); NIST AI RMF GenAI Profile (guidance); this lab’s cell is tool authority.

## Property (start here)

The lab agent may only invoke allowlisted tools. A model-proposed exec_sql is not authorization. The model is an untrusted client (8.1) that speaks English.

## Attacker capabilities and trust assumptions

- **Attacker:** Prompt injection in a note body; malicious retrieved doc.
- **Trust:** Local run_tool(name).
Change one channel, principal, or object class. Rewrite the invariant. Do not answer with a Top 10 / CWE Top 25 / scanner as the definition of security.

**Prompt:** Copilot in CI.

**Product sketch:** Clinic summarizer over charts.

Your answer must include: attacker capabilities, trust assumptions, a forbidden outcome, a test idea that would fail if the cell were false, residual risk, and whether a human path must meet WCAG 2.2.

## What graders reject

| Reject | Why |
|---|---|
| Tool or awareness-list name as the property | 1.1 |
| Framework default as the guarantee | LangChain default tools are not your matrix.… |
| Live-target plan | Lab policy |

## Practice

One page. No keys. The lab `labs/E1/e1-lab` stays the only running system you may break.
