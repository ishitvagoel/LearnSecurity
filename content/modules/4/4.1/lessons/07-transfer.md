# 4.1 — Identity lifecycle (7 Transfer)

**Kind:** transfer-challenge  
**Loop step:** 7 Transfer  
**Standards:** NIST SP 800-63-4 (final) identity lifecycle; ASVS 5.0.0 V6 (final). Deprovision is part of 1.2 over time.

## Property (start here)

After an account is deleted, that subject’s leftover session must not read notes. Lifecycle is complete mediation across account states, not a login screen.

## Attacker capabilities and trust assumptions

- **Attacker:** Stolen session cookie after the user left the org; a delayed worker using the old user id.
- **Trust:** Local user+session maps. Real IdP SLO is extra (4.5).
Change one channel, principal, or object class. Rewrite the invariant. Do not answer with a Top 10 / CWE Top 25 / scanner as the definition of security.

**Prompt:** Contractor access end-date; support impersonation tickets.

**Product sketch:** Clinic: departing clinician.

Your answer must include: attacker capabilities, trust assumptions, a forbidden outcome, a test idea that would fail if the cell were false, residual risk, and whether a human path must meet WCAG 2.2.

## Practice

One page. No keys. The lab `labs/4.1/4.1-lab` stays the only running system you may break.
